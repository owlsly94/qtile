# My rice of Qtile, using Catppuccin color scheme

Not much to say here, really.
After cloning, you'll need to install some PIP(Python) dependencies, so that added widgets
coupld properly work. Other than that, everything is pretty much Qtile build-in.

Font I use for the icons is - `Iosevka Nerd Font` and for everything else - `Comic Mono`.

I've tryed to keep everything clean and neat, so newbies could easily understand what's
going on.
